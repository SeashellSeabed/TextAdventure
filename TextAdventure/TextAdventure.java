You can still see light above you... or is it below you? To the side? \nYou're broken from your thoughts as water floods your slightly agape mouth, flowing down your throat as a cruel reminder of how much time you have left. \nThere is only two options for you. Do you gain the vigor to fight towards the light, or do you let death claim it's prize?\n [fight] in order to swim\n [give up] to float down to your demise.\n");
